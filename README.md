## Overview/Description

This project is a Flask-based web application designed to provide core user authentication functionalities. It serves as a practical example or a boilerplate for applications requiring user registration, login/logout capabilities, and session management, along with a simple protected dashboard area. 

Key technologies used include Python, Flask for the web framework, and SQLite for the database, ensuring a lightweight and portable setup. The application emphasizes secure password handling using bcrypt and structured data validation with Marshmallow.

## Features

*   **User Registration**: Securely register new users with email, username, and password. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt. Includes comprehensive password strength validation.
*   **User Login & Session Management**: Authenticate existing users and manage sessions. Sessions are configured with a defined timeout.
*   **Protected Dashboard**: A simple dashboard page accessible only to authenticated users.
*   **Logout**: Allows authenticated users to securely end their session.
*   **Password Strength Meter**: Client-side JavaScript provides real-time feedback on password strength during registration.
*   **Structured Validation**: Uses Marshmallow for robust server-side validation of registration data and a custom schema for login data.
*   **Modular Design**: Organized using Flask Blueprints for authentication (`auth`) and main application logic (`main`).

## Getting Started / Setup

For detailed setup instructions, please see the [Development Setup Guide](docs/setup.md).

**Quick Start:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-name>
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # Windows
    # python -m venv venv
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # For development (linters, testing tools)
    pip install flake8 black isort pytest pytest-cov 
    ```
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.flaskenv` file in the project root with the following (adjust `SECRET_KEY`):
    ```env
    FLASK_APP=src.app
    FLASK_DEBUG=1
    SECRET_KEY=your_strong_and_unique_secret_key
    ```
5.  **Initialize the database:**
    ```bash
    flask init-db
    ```
6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    flask run
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Running Tests

*   To run all unit and integration tests:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
*   To run tests with code coverage analysis for the `src` directory:
    ```bash
    pytest --cov=src
    ```
